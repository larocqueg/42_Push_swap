1- if stack_a ln > 3: Push 2 top nodes from a to b;

2- Untill stack_a len > 3: Push one node from a to b checkeing the cost and sorting b in descending order at the same time of the push

3- When stack_a len == 3: Use the sortThree

4- Pull all nodes from b to a

5- Organize stack_a in ascending order (Smallest to the biggest)
